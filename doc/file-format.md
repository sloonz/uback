# uback File Format, Version 0

A `uback` backup (default extension: `.ubkp`) consists of
a plaintext magic header, a plaintext options line, and an
[age](https://age-encryption.org/) stream containing a verification hash
followed by the compressed backup generated by the source.

The magic header is the constant `github.com/sloonz/uback/v0\n` (where
`\n` represents the newline character).

The options line consists of a set of key-value pairs of options,
followed by a newline (`\n`) character. Current options are `type`,
which indicates what source created the backup, and `compression`,
which is currently fixed to `zstd`.

The magic header and the options line, including their newline characters,
are hashed using SHA-256. The first 32 bytes of the age encrypted stream
consists of this hash, to prevent header tempering.

Unencrypted and uncompressed backups are planned but not yet implemented.
